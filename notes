Significant change in codon usage frequency using %Min-Max results
-	Two approaches to t-tests to determining significant change in codon usage frequency for two occasions. 		o	What we’ve conventionally called rare codon clusters: %Min-Max windows below 0 threshold		o	%Min-Max values above 0 threshold
-	%Min-Max value < 0		o	Compute t-test to length of rare codon cluster, calculate t-test to test significance, if significant, continuously add 1 window & recalculate t-test until no longer significant		o	Maybe clump rare codon clusters better—not broken up by at least 1 %Min-Max window > 0
-	%Min-Max value > 0		o	Iterate each %Min-Max window; keep track of greatest %Min-Max value within next 10 windows to divide into regions.		o	Compute t-test for each adjacent region. 				•	Test denote adjacent regions that have significant change in codon usage frequency		o	Peek up to next 10 windows because average length for co-occurring rare codon cluster is 10 %Min-Max windows		o	Lesser codon usage frequency hypothesized to correspond with slower translational speed		o	Will create a parallel sequence to %Min-Max sequence with -1, 0, & 1. 				•	-2:  Red—Region with rare codon cluster				•	-1:  Yellow—Region with slower translational speed
				•	0:  Gaps				•	1: Green—Region with quick/quicker translational speed
